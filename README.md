# ImageManipulation_OpenCV

##### To run this code, make sure you have the OpenCV library installed (pip install opencv-python). Place an image file named 'input_image.jpg' in the same directory as the Python script. After running the code, it will resize the image to a width and height of 500 pixels, convert it to grayscale, save the modified image as 'output_image.jpg', and display both the original and modified images in separate windows.

##### Please note that you will need to replace 'input_image.jpg' with the actual file name of the image you want to process. Additionally, make sure the image file is in the correct directory.

##### Remember, this is just a basic example of image manipulation using OpenCV. You can explore more advanced functionalities of the library and experiment with different image processing techniques based on your specific requirements.
