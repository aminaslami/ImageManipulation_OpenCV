# ImageManipulation_OpenCV

### To run this code, make sure you have the OpenCV library installed (pip install opencv-python). Place an image file named 'input_image.jpg' in the same directory as the Python script. After running the code, it will resize the image to a width and height of 500 pixels, convert it to grayscale, save the modified image as 'output_image.jpg', and display both the original and modified images in separate windows.
